<h1>Multi-Browser Support/Older Versions of Javascript</h1>
<p>Javascript is constantly introducing new features and deprecating old ones.
   Deploying a website that runs on most existing browsers would cause a huge amount of work, 
   checks in code, and also limit your ability to use new features. Fortunately there is a solution 
   to this. Use the latest features as you wish, then run your code through a 'transpiler' and deploy 
   the output. A 'transpiler' is a compiler that takes one version of software and puts out another.
   In this case, the transpiler we will be using, 'babel', keeps up-to-date with what browsers/browser
   versions are in common use and transpiles code such that all those browsers/versions support the
   output code. And the way it works is by taking new JS features and re-writing them using older
   JS code that is commonly supported. Thus we write using new code and deploy old code. Babel takes
   care of everything else.</p>
<h2>Install Babel in your project</h2>
<pre class="console">
> npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Puts more stuff in node_modules</li>
  <li>Adds more dependencies in package.json</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we are using webpack to bundle our JS application, we will also need the webpack loader for babel:</p>
<pre class="console">
> npm install --save-dev babel-loader
</pre>
<h2>Update the NPM and Webpack configurations</h2>
<p>Once babel and babel loader are installed, we have to update package.json and webpack.config.js to
   use them. First, in package.json add a "babel" section:</p>
<h3>package.json</h3>
<pre class="editor">
{
  ...
  "babel": {
    "presets": [
      "@babel/preset-env"
    ]
  },
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>This change to webpack.config.js tells webpack to run your code through babel and use the transpiled
   outout JS:</p>
<h3>webpack.config.js</h3>
<pre class="editor">
  /* entry */
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: ['babel-loader']
      }
    ]
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['*', '.js']
  },
  /* output */
</pre>
