<h1>Build a deployable website (html and JS) using Webpack</h1>
<p>At this point, if you are building a project that will be a user-facing front-end (i.e. a website), then you will want to package that project for deployment to a web server. Deployment means that we cut out all the development-only code (debuggers, libraries used to test and build stuff, etc) and to simplify and minimize the javascript (only deliver the libraries that you use, not everything installed on your development environment, combine all your javascript to one deployable js file). We are using webpack here, but you could use parcel or some other packaging tool.</p>

<h2>Create a distribution directory.</h2>
<p>Usually called 'dist' or 'build'</p>
<pre>
> mkdir dist
> touch dist/index.html
</pre>
<p>Edit dist/index.html and include only what you need (you no longer need to put all the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags in an html file. They are assumed now.</p>
<pre>
dist/index.html:

&lt;title&gt;New Project&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my New Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;script src="./bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

- note that there is no file called "bundle.js". Webpack will create that from all your .js files in your project that are needed by your website.
</pre>
<h2>Install Webpack on your project</h2>
<p>
You need to do this for each project. It copies the webpack modules into the node_modules directory (and creates the directory if it is not already there.) By using --save-dev, it will only using these modules during development. It will not put these modules into the deployable website because they are not used by your website and are not needed.
</p>
<pre>
> npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli

- installs three modules for use only in development in node_modules/
- added one line for each package in the devDependencies section of package.json
</pre>
<p>You will need to configure webpack to build your website, and then you'll need to update your start script.</p>

<p>To run your new website in a development mode, change the 'start' script in package.json:</p>
<pre>
In package.json:

"start": "webpack serve --mode development",

Add a new webpack.config.js file in the main directory of your project.

webpack.config.js:

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/index.js'),
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, '/dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js',
    },
    devServer: {
        static: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
    },
}

- uses path to better handle paths across different OSes
- points to your src/index.js script (in the future, other scripts go here)
- points to the output directory which already contains your html files
- specifies the bundle.js file that webpack will create from your js files. That will go in /dist

Now you can run this on the command line:

> npm start
</pre>
<p>Or using VS Code's NPM Intellisense extension, chose NPM SCRIPTS->package.json->start run button</p>
<p>In both cases, use your browser to go to the link: http://localhost:8080/</p>
